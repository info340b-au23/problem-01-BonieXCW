        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a> is the titular character of the immensely popular book series 
        by J.K. Rowling and its corresponding film franchise. He is a young wizard 
        who discovers his magical abilities on his eleventh birthday when he receives
         an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With his 
         distinctive lightning bolt scar on his forehead, which he acquired as a baby 
         during an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort, Harry becomes a symbol of hope 
         in the wizarding world. Throughout the series, he embarks on numerous 
         adventures with his friends Ron and Hermione, facing challenges, dark forces, 
         and uncovering his own destiny as "The Boy Who Lived." Harry's character is 
         defined by his bravery, loyalty, and unwavering determination to stand up 
         against injustice and protect his loved ones. </p>
